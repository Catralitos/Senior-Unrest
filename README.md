# Senior Unrest

Senior Unrest is a roguelike game that takes place in an old lady's house (or the recollection of her house...). Strange creatures disturb her sleep mercilessly. Her nights quickly become something worthy of a nightmare. Even the rooms seem to morph into new configurations. Is all this really happening or is it just something taken from the old lady's mind?

Will you help her strive through the night?  

This game was developed in Unity over a week as part of the 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2023 (https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2023).

It features grid based movement, a turn based system, procedural generation and upgrade mechanics.
